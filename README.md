# Windows GUI for converting between decimal and binary numbers

Small project created for my personal learning purpose only.

Beside of the Python files for creating the GUI, this project contains the executable file for Windows made using pyinstaller.
For that I recommend the video: [How to Convert any Python File to .EXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4).
